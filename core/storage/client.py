"""aiobotocore-backed S3 client used for source-file storage.

The service uploads user-provided source data files to ``STORAGE_BUCKET``
(MinIO in dev). The worker reads them back during generation and deletes
them once the row reaches a terminal state. The shape is deliberately
function-based — there's no client singleton to wire into the FastAPI
lifespan or the worker startup. aiobotocore clients are async-context
managers; opening one per operation is cheap because the underlying
aiohttp connector pool is shared across the asyncio loop.
